# Nand2Tetris
Implementation of the hardware projects in Nand2Tetris.

The projects cover the building of a computer architecture beginning with Nand logic gates to more complex logic gates, chips, registers, memory modules, all the way to the complete cultivation of a complete computer architecture.

The chips and various modules are created and realised via the Hardware Description Language (HDL).
(Includes dabbling in some assembly)
