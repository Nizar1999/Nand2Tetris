Implementation of the projects for the following chapters in [Nand2Tetris]("https://www.nand2tetris.org/")

The projects cover the building of a computer architecture beginning with Nand logic gates to more complex logic gates, chips, registers, memory modules, all the way to the complete cultivation of a complete computer architecture.

The chips and various modules are created and realised via the Hardware Description Language (HDL).
